# Start in the repository with the change. This could be a component module
# or the control repository. We're assuming each repository is still on the
# branch from the last step, and no pulls or branch changes are necessary.

# Edit the file with the targeted changes
vim manifests/manifest.pp

# Add the file to the git staging area
git add manifests/manifest.pp

# Commit the file to the repository
git commit -m 'Fixing specific bug'

# Push the repository back to upstream origin
git push origin new_feature

# From the Puppet Master, or a workstation with PE Client Tools

# Log in with RBAC
puppet-access login

# Deploy the environment
puppet-code deploy new_feature -w

# On the test node

# Run the agent, observe the results
puppet agent -t

# Repeat as necessary until issues are solved
