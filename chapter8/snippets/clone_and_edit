git clone git@gitserver.com:puppet/module.git

# If the repository is already local on the system, we'll just want to update our
# local master branch
git pull origin master

# Check out a new environment based on the existing master branch, which is the
# default branch of a git repository, and the branch we should start on on a clone.
git checkout -b new_feature

# We'll edit some files to add new features

# Adding new paramters to init

# Adding a new feature to config
vim manifests/config.pp
# Ensuring the new feature is represented in the deployed template
vim templates/file.epp

# Add all edited files to git staging, assuming you're at the base of the repository
git add .

# Add an atomic commit, not only describing what the commit is, but why it was done
git commit -m 'Added new code to support feature requested by client'

# Push this code back to the origin repository as the new branch
