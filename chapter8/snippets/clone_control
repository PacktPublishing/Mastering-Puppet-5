# This step is not needed if the repository is already on the local file system
git clone git@gitserver.com:puppet/control-repo.git

# We'll assume integration is the pre-production branch used by the organization
# to stage changes before moving into production-like branches
# Remember, there usually is no master branch in a control repository, so we want
# to target a specific branch to work against.
git checkout integration

# If this repo has been freshly cloned, git pull shouldn't provide any new updates,
# but it's safe to run either way. If the repository has already been cloned in the
# past, you definitely want to run this command to pull the latest commits from 
# upstream.
git pull origin integration

# We'll perform a second checkout, with the -b flag to indicate a new branch based on the existing branch
git checkout -b new_feature
